# Video_Editor_using-Python3
## Python Programming
I use different libraries to made this program.
- [ ] MoviePy
- [ ] gTTS
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] OS
- [ ] Math

In this Program we have to save all three files in the same directory that is 
1.  main.py 
2.  clip_detail.csv 
3.  text2speech.csv

Then we feed details like directory of Video File want to edit with those clip timing in [ clip_detail.csv ].

Then if you want to add Some additional Speech feed those details in [ text2speech.csv ].

After this just run the file [ main.py ].

And the Output Video got saved in same directory as [ Output_Video.mp4 ] after Completion.
